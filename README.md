# FruitCollect
A classic fruit Collecting game made with pygame

Install pygame before running: 
`pip install pygame`

Rules:
Random fruits will drop from the sky from random positions and you have to catch them using the basket.

You can use the mouse to move the basket left and right.

If you miss the fruit and it falls to the ground **10 times**, you lose.

There are four levels - 

i) **Easy** : Lasts till you reach 20 points.

ii) **Medium** : Lasts from 20 points to 50 points.

iii) **Hard** : Starts at 50 points and goes on until 100 points.

iv) **Insane** : Hardest level, starts from 100 points and basket speed will also be increased in this level so that 
catching the fruits is not impossible.

To quit the game manually, press "**q**".

Everytime you get a new highscore, the score will be saved to the 'scores.json' file and it will be displayed on the screen.
